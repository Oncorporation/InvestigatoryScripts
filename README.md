# InvestigatoryScripts
scripts used to investigate data on the internet

Because search engines and many LLM are censored, it is difficult to find information on the internet. This repository contains scripts that can be used to investigate data on the internet.


## Installation

None. However, these scripts are written in Python and may require the custom libraries. These libraries links are included in the repository.
